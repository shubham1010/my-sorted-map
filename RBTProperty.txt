Properties of red black tree:
1) Every node is either red or black, Root node is always black.
2) Every leaf is black.
3) If a node is red, then both it's children are black.
4) Every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number of black nodes.

Conditions:

1) If tree is empty, create newnode as root node with black colour.
2) If tree is not empty, create newnode as leaf node with red colour.
3) If parent of newnode is black then exit.
3) If parent of newnode is red, then check the colour of parent's sibling of newnode:
	a) If colour is black or null then do suitable rotation and recolour.
	b) If colour is red then recolor and also check if parent's parent of newnode is not root node then recolour it and recheck.
