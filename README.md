### This is implementation of map of STL.

## I'm calling this Vesion-1.

### Currently this implementation is done with: 

## 1) insert(key,value) => Takes O(1) (as it is unordered). It can insert key which is already present in the dictionary.

## 2) erase(key) => Takes O(n) (keys could be any but it should be inserted).

## 3) show() => Taking O(n*n) time to display data in ordered form with respect to key.

### Upcoming Features:
	1) Data should get display in sorted manner with O(n) complexity.
	2) Deletion of keys should get done in O(log(n)) time.
	3) Allow to insert only unique keys.
	4) Exceptions whenever necessary require.
